package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	// println("Hello Gophers!")

	// builtin println function is very limited

	// So more often when we are printinga messages like this is we are going too reach for a function in standard library in order to do that we have to learn to import the package

	// So we import package called fmt which allow us to work with stings

	fmt.Println("Hello Gophers!")

}
