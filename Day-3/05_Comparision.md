`a,b := 10,5`
1. **`==` :-** checks if the LHS is equal to RHS `c := a == b` 
2. **`!=` :-** checks if the LHS is not equal to RHS `c = a != b`
3. **`<` :-** checks if the LHS is less than RHS `c = a < b`  
4. **`<=` :-** checks if the LHS is less than or equal to RHS `c = a >= b` 
5. **`>` :-** checks if the LHS is greater than RHS `c = a > b`  
6. **`>=` :-** checks if the LHS is greater than or equal to RHS `c = a >= b`
