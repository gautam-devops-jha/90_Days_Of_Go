# Introduction 

Since it's initial release Go has grown to become one of the most important languages in morden software development. 

# Why Go created?
- Go was actually created within google organization, and the engineers that started developing GO created it because they recognized some challenges with the languages that were commonly used  in that organization at that time. 
- If we look at the goals of software development at very very high level, we might break it down into these 3 categories. 
    1. **We want efficient compilation** We don't want our programmers annd our engineers sitting around waiting for our applications to compile. We'd like them to stay productive and stay in that programming mindset. So waiting for 20 or 30 minutes for an application to compile really isn't going to do it for us. 
    2. **We want efficient execution** Time is money, and the more efficient a programming language is, the less time it takes to execute a given task, and therefore, the more money it saves the organization. So Google, like rest of us, wants their applications to run efficiently. 
    3. **Ease of Programming** We have a software requirement, and that is the ease of programming with the language. Teams at google are constantly ramping engineers onto and off of themselves, and so the ability to ramp up a new engineer quickly on the software that the team is using is very important source of efficiency gain thhroughout the entire Google organization. 

- 3 most commonly used programming language used used in Google was 
    1. **C++** :- Very effecient execution but not efficient compilation and ease of programming
    2. **Java** :- Effecient compilation and Effecient execution but nnot ease of programming
    3. **Python** :- Ease of programming and Effecient compilation but not efficient execution.

So google was looking at how do we combine efficient compilation, effecient execution, and ease of programming? And that led to creation of Go.
